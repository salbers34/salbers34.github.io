### Introduction
Hello! My name is Skylar Albers, and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to introduce myself. I am an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribe and I am also Hunkpapa Lakhota from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. I am currently just finishing my first year in the Computer Information Technology program at United Tribes Technical College. I graduted with my Generals in May of 2023 because I had no idea what I wanted to go into, but CIT caught eye so I said why not?! It's been great so far!

Outside of schooling and this internship, I'm passionate about spending time with my friends and family. 

In the coming months, I'm excited to learn about environmental science and python programming. I'm hopeful that learning these new skills will contribute to my professional life in the near future, whether that be schooling or job wise. I'm eager to make the most of every opportunity that [ESIIL](https://esiil.org) Stars brings me!

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm looking forward to connecting with each of you and exploring potential ways to collaborate and grow together!
